# MIPS-processor
3rd Computer Engineering project of MIPS processor implementation using Verilog

We implemented an assembler that you can use using a GUI implemented using Python-Tkinter

An interactive GUI implementaion of the data path is implemented [here](https://github.com/ahmedyehia1/MIPS-Processor-Educational-software)
